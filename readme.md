# Installing Python

## Bare-bones Python

Python without any special software installed can be downloaded from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
I recommend installing Python 3, if you would like to test any of the examples in this presentation.

## Python with Scientific Libraries

Anaconda is a great python distribution which comes with the most used packages for data science.
If you would like to use Python for data analysis, machine learning etc., then I recommend installing Anaconda.
Anaconda can be installed from [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Again, I recommend the Python 3 version.

# Installing Python Packages

If you find a python package that you would like to install, you can use pip (Python Package Index).
Pip comes with the default Python installation. To install a package using pip, use the following command:

    pip install <package name>

# Installing a Python IDE

I recommend installing a Python IDE to edit your Python scripts. The one I prefer is PyCharm, which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
The "Community" edition is more than sufficient for most tasks.

When you have installed PyCharm, you need to set the path to your Python installation. This is can be done after you have created your first project.
The path to your Python installation should be set in:

    File > Settings > Preferences > Project:<project name> > Project Interpreter
